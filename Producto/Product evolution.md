### About the product and its description.
<justify>For the first assignment we defined that the main objective of TuriAmigos is to achieve a more interactive trip for users; implementing the possibility of coexisting and meeting with other tourists, locals, foreign people living in Merida or tour guides; this using features such as a radar style interface that will indicate which other users of the app are in a close range, without revealing the exact location; this function will allow through a messenger, to contact other people.</justify> 
<justify>For the second assignment we kept the general objective fixed and added functionalities to detect tourists up to the private messaging system. This allowed us to focus on improving quality and optimizing the development time of both the prototype and the final product.</justify> 
<justify>Finally, for the third assignment, we complemented the functions with necessary elements such as an interface where the user can retrieve his password, view the profile of other users, as well as visualize that his location was sent correctly through the chat.</justify>
