## **Innovation**

Our product will allow users to meet with other nearby tourists through the proximity radar, having the possibility of sending a request to the user to agree on a specific point to meet.

 One of the innovations that our product has is that you will be able to make meetings and choose plans immediately, this because we have a messaging system, and a function that allows them to share their locations or assign a point on the map to meet; unlike other tourism applications where you have to book a tour guide or agree long before with another tourist to meet at a certain place. 
 
 We have made tourism a practice that is easier to share with people, in fact, from each user's profile you can see the amount of trips they have taken and the opinions of people when sightseeing with that user. Our application is full of people who like tourism and are looking for other users with the same hobby, besides being able to perform activities with those who are close to them
