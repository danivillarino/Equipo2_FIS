Users

Knowing who we make a product for is like knowing your friends. If you know what they like and need, you can plan something special that really appeals to them. Similarly, when we develop applications, understanding who the users are helps us make something that perfectly suits them. It's like setting the stage for a party: if you know who's coming, you can create an environment that makes them feel comfortable and enjoy themselves to the fullest. In the digital world, knowing your audience not only makes your product great, but also makes it easier for people to find what they're looking for.

The "super tourist" of our Mérida tourism app. We're talking about peeps who are always on the lookout for a shot to get out, ever on the hunt for new adventures and squeezing every chance they get. This tourist is like the beating heart of our app.
When we cooked up the app, we kind of stepped into the shoes of these tourists who are really stoked about checking out Mérida. We made sure the app is like, crazy easy to use, with info right where you need it. We wanna be that buddy that helps you make smart-ish choices about where to go, what to do, and how to make the most out of your time in the city. Long story short, we're working to make your Mérida experience unforgettable, totally tailored to your vibes and preferences. We want you to feel at home and that every moment is, like, a bit special!

The secondary user in our app would be the locals in Mérida who, honestly, are not so fanatical about always planning their time, but every once in a while they like to go exploring. They don't check the app as often as tourists do, but when the occasion strikes, they consult it for some cool suggestions on what to do in their own city. While they're not as obsessive as the tourists, they can still use recommendations to enhance those occasional travel or discovery experiences in Mérida, so basically, we're here to make their local exploration time more interesting and hassle-free!

+ potential user

A potential user in a tourism app would be like someone who is about to embark on a new adventure with the app. It's like that friend who hasn't downloaded the app yet, but is thinking about doing so soon. Perhaps they are planning a vacation, looking for suggestions for their next getaway, or just curious about exciting places. This potential user has the opportunity to dive into the app and become a regular explorer if they find the tools and information it offers interesting enough.
