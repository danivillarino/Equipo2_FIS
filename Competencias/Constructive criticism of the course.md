## Constructive criticism of the course

From our point of view there are certain aspects which do not convince us. 
It would be beneficial to incorporate more team programming practice. Although there are group software development assignments, most focus on planning and design. Implementing collaborative development sprints would allow the application of more teamwork skills, as well as the use of version control and continuous integration tools, among others.

It is important to broaden the focus on agile methodologies. Although concepts such as Scrum or Kanban are mentioned, they are superficially addressed. Going deeper into these agile frameworks would better prepare students for real projects that employ these methodologies.

It would be advisable to reduce the length of written reports. While it is important to develop documentation, overly long reports consume a lot of student time. It would be beneficial to balance this with a greater emphasis on presentations, videos, and interactive prototypes. It would also be valuable to incorporate an introductory session on software engineering ethics. This is a relevant topic in professional practice that deserves special attention in the program.

Increase the use of professional tools. While some such as Git or Trello are used, it would be beneficial to expand the variety of options, such as Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, SonarQube, among others. This would better prepare students for real work environments.

In summary, focusing more on practical learning, agile methodologies, professional ethics and the use of current tools in the field would enhance students' skills and the value of the course for overall learning in the area rather than within the university.
