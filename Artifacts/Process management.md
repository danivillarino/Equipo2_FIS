## Process management
In the process management involved in this sprint, we valued important artifacts, such as the [Individual Contribution Metric](https://github.com/danivillarino/Equipo2_FIS/blob/e703fce82f840feb6f5d2259f535150c2a7c1ebb/Proceso/All%20activity%20scores.md), 
which played an important role in the planning of each sprint. During the activities, we managed to coordinate in such a way that the proposed objectives were achieved. For this, we followed the "Design Sprint" methodology, which is usually used by companies to design and develop products in short and iterative cycles. This process seeks ideation, prototyping, testing and refinement. 

For the management and recording of activity dates, as well as the sprint phases, we use Gantt Project, a tool that allows us to perform consecutive or simultaneous tasks. Similarly, to manage the problems and solutions that arose, we used the logbook, with this and the descriptions of the sprints a detailed follow-up is made in both directions. 


The work to which special attention was dedicated was the design of the user interface, we made a prototype by simultaneous work in the web tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com),  which was effective functionalities for the design, along with the team has given the appropriate monitoring for its proper development.

Thue use of the [Binnacle](https://github.com/danivillarino/Equipo2_FIS/blob/Tercera-entrega/Artifacts/Binnacle.md)  was key to record the problems and solutions to optimize the development processes and meet the sprint dates.
