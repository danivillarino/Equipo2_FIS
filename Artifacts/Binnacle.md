| Week 1 : October 2 - October 8 | Team meeting for activity planning and role assignments, as well as design of the contribution metric. | A better timeline management was needed. | Sprints were used so the team could maintain a shcedule for activities. GanttProject was implemented as a tool for activity programming. | 
| Week 2 : October 9 - October 15 | First meeting with the teacher for progress review. | During the meeting, some non functional requirements were reviewed and changes were suggested. | The requirement was later reviewed by the team and corrected. | 
| Week 3: October 16 - October 22 | UI design and tool changes. Third team meeting | For practical purposes, the UI Design tool was changed form After Effects to Figma, in order to develop a higher-fidelity prototype with a more simple tool, also, with additional characteristics that would be useful for later development stages, such as informal testings and UX development. | We inmediatly focused on familiarizing ourselves with the new UI design tool and the frecuency of team meetings increased for making creative choices for the UIs. |  
| Week 4: October 23 - October 30 | Team meeting for interface validation. | Developing a method was required for UI validation with the team and initial testers. | Artifacts such as use cases and user stories were useful for creating a series of instructions so testers could evaluate the UI and present comments. | 
| Week 5 : October 30 -  November 6 | Last team meeting for final comments on the repository organization. | A file management micro-protocol was required so we could properly upload our final artiffacts to the repository and merge everything together. | We established that files could be organized according to the assignment rubric, also giving us a better organization so we could create a proper index inside the branch. |
