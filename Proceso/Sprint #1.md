Sprint #1 - Start: October 1 End: October 15

For the first sprint, we focused primarily on preparing documentation effectively to optimize the development of a medium fidelity prototype.

During the weekly meeting on October 2, 2023, the activities to start developing the individual contribution metrics were roughly 
distributed. The requirements were radically changed to optimize the writing of use cases and user stories, which were also performed within the sprint.
The writing of documentation was intensified and the distribution of sprints was decided.

Activities performed:

- User stories
- Requirements evolution
- Individual contribution metrics
- Timeline
- Process management
- Product evolution
