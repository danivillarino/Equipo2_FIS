## Informal testings

For the tests, each team member was in charge of choosing 2 people to use the prototype to have a total of 12 testers, each of whom timed the time it took them to perform the following actions:

 - Create an account
  - Press "forgot my password"
  - Login
  - Activate the radar
  - Enter a user's profile
-   Rate the user
  - Report the user
 -  Send Message
 -  Send location
 -  Go to the chat library
  - Accept a message request
  - Go to your own profile
  - Edit your own profile

After collecting the data, the average time it took the testers to perform these tests was 1 minute and 30 seconds.

The feedback they gave us was that the app is intuitive, it is easy to use, the color palette is pleasing to the eye and they really liked the design of the app.
